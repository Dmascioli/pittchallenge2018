Hello my name is Tyler Patterson and I am a Pharmacist at Falk’s Pharmacy. 
I graduated in 2007 from the University of Pittsburgh from the PharmD program.
I have spent time working at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota and have been a pharmacist here at Falk’s for 3 years. I am also a die-hard Pittsburgh sports fan, I can’t get enough of watching the Penguins and steelers play.


Most patients don't realize what the drugs they are prescribed do to their bodies. Also most pharmacists don’t have any idea why they are prescribing a certain medicine to patients. We wanted a way to solve both of these issues. Pharmacies have more data on the patients and can now better educate their patients about the medications that they are taking. The patients now have a way to find the pharmacy that best suits their needs for the medication and the price.


1. Gives the patients more control over their prescriptions. They can choose a pharmacy based on how the pharmacist is specialized. 
2. Allows the pharmacists to see more information on the patients so that it can help the pharmacists explain the purpose of the medicine to the patients and what things that could go wrong.
3. Has a review system for patients to rate their pharmacies based on their experience there and how well the pharmacist attempted to help them.
4. Pharmacists can now also build a brand around the service with the reviews from patients incentivising them to give the best service possible.
5. Gives pharmacists a place to review their education efforts through reviews. ## How we built it Using Java (Swing and AWT), and Adobe Illustrator, we made a user interface that showcases the features of our app. The backend (processing reviews and managing accounts) is written in Java.
